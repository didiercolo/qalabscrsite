# QALabs — Website Generation Prompt
## Minimalist, Technical, Disruptive Web Design

---

## Purpose

This prompt is designed to generate the official QALabs website using AI tools such as **Claude** or **Antigravity**.

The goal is to create a **modern, minimalist, engineering-first website** that:
- Does NOT look like a corporate company site
- Feels like a technical exploration lab
- Attracts senior-minded QA professionals and engineering leaders
- Communicates credibility, depth, and disruption
- Delivers an excellent, responsive user experience

## MASTER PROMPT (COPY / PASTE)

You are a senior product designer and frontend engineer designing a modern, high-impact website for a technical brand called **QALabs**.

### Brand Context

QALabs is **not** a traditional company, consultancy, or academy.

It is a **technical exploration lab** where modern QA systems are designed, tested, and implemented.

The brand is:
- Engineering-first
- System-oriented
- AI-aware but not hype-driven
- Focused on architecture and decision-making, not tool execution
- Minimalist, professional, and intentionally disruptive

This website should feel like:
- An engineering lab
- A skunkworks team
- A place where real technical work happens

Avoid anything that feels:
- Corporate
- Marketing-heavy
- Generic SaaS
- Like an online course platform

---

### Visual & Design Direction

Design a **minimalist, modern, professional interface** with:

- Strong typography hierarchy
- Generous white space
- Clear grid systems
- Clean, sharp layouts
- Engineering-inspired visuals (diagrams, flows, system maps)
- No stock office photography
- No corporate clichés

The site should feel:
- Serious
- Technical
- Forward-looking
- Credible
- Selective (not designed for everyone)

Use:
- Dark or neutral bases (charcoal, deep blue, off-white)
- High-contrast accents (cyan, electric blue)
- Subtle motion (micro-interactions, hover states, transitions)
- Technical or monospace accents where appropriate

---

### UX Principles

- Mobile-first
- Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Fast-loading and performance-aware
- Accessible and readable
- Clear visual rhythm
- Focused user flow (no clutter)

Primary UX goal:

> Make QA professionals and engineering leaders feel:  
> “This is not another company website. These people think deeply about systems.”

---

### Site Structure (MVP)

Generate the following pages:

1. **Home**
   - Strong technical hero section
   - Clear statement of philosophy
   - Introduction to “The Lab”
   - Sections for QA professionals and for teams
   - Clear but non-pushy CTAs

2. **The Lab**
   - Explain QALabs as a technical exploration environment
   - Emphasize experimentation, system design, and AI exploration
   - Use conceptual diagrams or system visuals

3. **QA Immersion Program**
   - Present mentoring as a technical immersion
   - Focus on senior-level thinking, architecture, and decision-making
   - Avoid sales language

4. **Technical Partnership for Teams**
   - Explain collaboration with engineering teams
   - Emphasize capability-building over deliverables

5. **Philosophy**
   - Core beliefs about QA, quality, systems, and AI
   - Manifesto-style content

6. **Contact**
   - Minimal contact form
   - Calendly-style scheduling
   - Clear expectations

---

### Content Guidelines

Use language that is:
- Direct
- Technical
- Confident
- Precise

Avoid:
- Buzzwords without context
- Over-promising
- Marketing fluff
- Generic headlines

Prefer:
- Declarative statements
- Engineering metaphors
- System-level thinking
- Explicit trade-offs

Tone:
> Engineering-first. Mentor-driven. Disruptive but credible.

---

### Technical Output Requirements

- Responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Clean semantic HTML structure
- Modern CSS (Grid / Flexbox)
- Optional lightweight JavaScript for interactions
- Accessibility best practices (WCAG)
- Performance-aware design choices

The final result should feel like:
> A modern technical lab website — not a corporate brochure.

---

## Usage Notes

- If the tool supports iteration, generate **Home + visual system first**, then expand.
- If the output feels too “SaaS” or “marketing-driven”, refine with:
  > “Make it more engineering-driven and less marketing-oriented.”
- If possible, provide the QALabs brand/content Markdown as source material.

---

## Design Benchmark (Mental Model)

Closer to:
- Engineering-focused product sites
- Internal R&D labs
- Advanced dev tools websites

Far from:
- Consulting firms
- Training platforms
- Corporate service websites

---

## End Goal

The site should communicate:

> “This is where QA is designed, not sold.”
